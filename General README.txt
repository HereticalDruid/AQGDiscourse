The paths of the models required for the programming question generation need to be added into config.txt. These models are language specific, and can be generated by running the DTreeTrain.py file. This script will take as input a file of input dataset, dataSet.txt. This dataset needs to be filled in by the user, with equal quantities of natural and programming language sentences, following the process described below:
The dataset.txt is populated with sentences as described above, with each sentence ended with 0 for natural sentences, 1 for programming.
The dataGen.py script is run, producing the intermediate dataset file.
The DTreeTrain.py script is then run to generate the pickle files needed for the execution of the program.
For the features, there are also some required parameters, which the user has to set in the featureConfig.json. They are the following:
KEYWORDS: List of reserved keywords in the chosen programming language.
OPERATOR_LIST: List of common operators in the language.
COMMENT_SINGLE: List of markers used to begin single line comments. (Eg. ['\\'] for Java)
COMMENT_MULTIPLE: List of lists, where each of the inner lists is a pair of markers used to begin and end multiline comments. (Eg. [["/*","*/"],["/**","*/"]])
dataFile: The training file as mentioned in point 1 (dataSet.txt here).
