So far in these lectures, we have discussed the concepts of Object Oriented Programming.0
// recursion1
import java.util.*;1
public class Client1
We have also discussed programs having constants, variables,simple input / output, assignment, expressions.0
We have dwelt in detail about thedifferent aspects of operators like precedence, association and rank.0
We have also made some simple classes with attributes(fields) and behaviour(methods or functions).0
{1
We have also mentioned the special function toinitialize an object - called its constructor.0
	public static void main(String[] args)1
We make a class to represent an entity or a thing or an idea.0
A class is like a userdefined type.0
A class contains a number of attributes.0
	{1
We normally put a group ofrelated classes into a file.0
Why should we segregate our classes into differentfiles?Let us consider a simple analogy.0
Would people at McDonalds make burgers andeat those themselves – (they may also eat a few – not sure though).0
Customers ofMcDonalds and people of McDonalds enjoy their own lives – but interact at thecounter.0
We would like to clearly distinguish between the creator of the class – he givesservice and the user of the class(client) – he uses the service the creator provides.0
McDonald can cater to number of different types of customers.0
Customers mayalso choose a different joint if they do not like McDonald.0
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);1
Let us look at some examples.0
In these discussions, we will use a simple exampleof a class - Rect – which abstracts a rectangle.0
My rectangle has two attributeslength called l and breadth called b.0
		int n = scanner.nextInt();1
		MyNum mynum1 = new MyNum(n);1
Both are of type int.0
I am sure your rectanglecould be different.0
We know that everything changes in this world.0
How do we manage change? Thedeveloper of the class Rect should tell the client that he would not change thosethat the client can use and he may change those which the client cannot use.0
		int sum = mynum1.findSum();1
		System.out.println("sum : " + sum);1
		scanner.close();1
He should hide the implementation and expose the interface.0
In this example, the client accesses the interface of Rect.0
	}1
Changes toimplementation of Rect will not affect the client.0
}1
public class MyNum1
In this example, can the Client find the area of a rectangle within which a smallrectangle is cut out? The answer is a NO as the client can only display the areaand cannot get the area.0
This implementation of findArea is flawed.0
It should return the area back to theclient.0
The client can then decide what to do with it.0
So far we have been telling you the truth, but not the whole truth.0
{1
The operator new allocates memory for the fields of Rect andthen calls a special method called the constructor.0
This constructor is used toinitialize an object.0
	private int val;1
	public MyNum(int val)1
It does not create an object.0
Constructor can have parameters.0
	{1
Compiler provides a constructor which has noparameters.0
		this.val = val;1
	}1
This is called a default constructor.0
	public int findSum() // wrapper for a recursive method1
This will vanish when we makeout own constructor.0
	{1
The client may want to use our class to initialize objects indifferent ways.0
You may order pizza with different toppings and with or withoutcoke.0
		return findSumRecursive(val);1
	}1
	private int findSumRecursive(int val)1
We may have overloaded constructors to support what the client wants.0
	{1
Giving a value or set of values to a variable or an object at the point of creation iscalled initialization.0
Local variables are not initialized by default.0
Object is created by using the operator new.0
		if(val == 0)1
It allocates memory and calls theconstructor.0
Our rectangle has changed with an additional field to indicate whether therectangle is a square.0
It has methods to get the values of the attributes for theclient.0
		{1
			return 0;1
		}1
		else1
		{1
These are called getters.0
			return val % 10 + findSumRecursive(val / 10);1
		}1
We may have methods to change the values ofthe attributes of an object.0
These are called setters.0
Observe that isSquare depends on the other fields – we say it is a computed field.0
This is given a value in the constructors.0
	}1
}1
import java.util.*;1
Constructors are overloaded to make the client life easier.0
public class Client1
Default constructor initializes the fields to some default (not reasonable in thisexample – could not think of a default rectangle!).0
{1
	public static void main(String[] args)1
	{1
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);1
		int m;1
		int n;1
We have a constructor which creates a square – takes only one argument.0
We have also a constructor which takes two arguments.0
If a constructor does everything tht another constructor does and then somethingmore, we can make one call the other.0
		m = scanner.nextInt();1
		n = scanner.nextInt();1
We want to make Dosa and Dosa-with-Ghee in our eatery.0
If the latter doeseverything of the former, then we can have one cook, make Dosa and thenanother cook(I can fit in here), add ghee to it.0
Something for you to experiment.0
In java, we use final to state that something isa constant – that it will not change once given a value.0
		Pair pair = new Pair(m, n);1
		System.out.println("result : " + pair.gcd()); 1
Your usn will not changeduring your stay in our college.0
Your pan numbers (assuming that you are payingincome tax) will not change.0
		scanner.close();1
Your passport number will not change even though itis not the same for your friend.0
A variable is given a location as the control enters the body of the method.0
Whenthe control leaves the method, the memory given to the variable is taken back.0
So we say that the variable has life – has existence – in that block.0
	}1
An object gets life when the new operator is called.0
At the end of the block thereference holding reference to the object is removed – dies.0
But the objectremains but we have no way of accessing it.0
So, we have a location – in this case –an object – which has no access.0
Such a thing is called garbage.0
}1
Creation ofgarbage decreases the memory available.0
public class Pair1
When memory becomes low, Javaclears all these locations and make them useful again.0
This concept is calledgarbage collection.0
{1
This concept is similar to what happens in our canteens.0
You all consume coffeand/or tea.0
After sometime there will be no cups available.0
Then the manager callsout for the boy to clean these cups and make them useful again.0
We may want to change the sides of a rectangle – modify by a factor.0
	private int m;1
We maywant to change the length and the breadth by different factors.0
	private int n; 1
So, we require twomethods.0
	public Pair(int m, int n)1
	{1
Should we call by different names or same name? Giving the samename makes the life of the client easier.0
		this.m = m;1
He has to remember just one name.0
Wemay observe that the operator + stands for addition of all numeric types.0
		this.n = n;1
	}1
Theoperations carried internally are different.0
This concept of giving the same namefor a group of methods logically similar is called overloading.0
	public String toString()1
	{1
Your friend has a key to her locker in the bank – has something very valuable forher (look at this.0
		return "m : " + m + " n : " + n;1
	}	1
	int gcd()1
	{1
Suddenly the keyboard changed the gender!).0
Let us say youhave made a copy of your friend's key.0
If you file(mechanical filing – not file onyour computer), your friend's key will not change.0
reference.0
	 	return gcdRecursive(m, n);1
If you change the object using the parameter, whatever theargument refers to would be changed.0
Your friend has a key to her locker in the bank – has something very valuable forher.0
	}1
Let us say you have made a copy of your friend's key.0
	int gcdRecursive(int m, int n)1
	{1
		if(m == n)1
If you access the lockerthrough your key(copy of your friend's key) – you are a nice person – so you mayput something in the locker – not a snake of course), then your friend's locker haschanged.0
		{1
The next time your friend opens the locker, she will get the shock of herlife.0
Let us make another class – a triangle – to represent a Triangle of geometry.0
			return m;1
Wewill specify the three sides and we will assume that the triangle is formed.0
		}1
Can weclassify the triangle as equilateral, isosceles or scalene? I am a bit sloppy andproviding some computed members as interfaces – equi, iso and scalene.0
		else if(m > n)1
		{1
Pleasedo not change them in the client code.0
			return gcdRecursive(m - n, n);1
		}1
If you do, then you may end up with atriangle which is all of them simultaneously.0
		else1
You may change this class and makeit better by providing methods to check whether the triangle is equilateral,isosceles or scalene.0
		{1
Some homework for you.0
We are using selection (if statement) to choose between the alternatives.0
We are using boolean fields to hold the result of these comparisons.0
			return gcdRecursive(m, n - m);1
Observe bydefault, all these boolean fields become false because of default initializationbased on type.0
In this example, we have if within if, Such a construct is called nested ifstatement.0
If the first operand of && operator is false, then the whole expression is false.0
		}1
	}1
}1
There is no necessity to evaluate the second operand.0
// recursion1
If the first operand of || operator is true, then the whole expression is true.0
import java.util.*;1
public class Client1
{1
Thereis no necessity to evaluate the second operand.0
We can stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is found out.0
	public static void main(String[] args)1
	{1
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);1
That what happens inJava.0
This is called short circuit evaluation.0
We count the number of times a pair of sides match.0
It can be 3 or 1 or 0.0
Think:why it is never 2? Based on that we can classify a triangle.0
		int n = scanner.nextInt();1
		MyNum mynum1 = new MyNum(n);1
Here, we have tocompare a single integer variable with number of constants for equality.0
In suchcases, we prefer the switch statement.0
The value of the expression of switchdecides the point of entry into the switch clauses (and not exit.0
Thats why we usebreak to take the control out of the block!).0
		mynum1.solveTowerOfHanoi();1
We can have a 'catch all' clause – thatis called default.0
This is somewhat similar to BODMAS rule that we learn in arithmetic, but morecomplicated as there are lots of operators in these programming languages.0
		scanner.close();1
Theorder of evaluation of operators depends on the precedence.0
Operators withhigher precedence will be evaluated first.0
	}1
What if more than one operator in an expression has the same precedence? Inthat case, we evaluate left to right or right to left depending on the operator.0
Thisconcept is called association.0
}1
The number of operands required for an operator is called arity.0
public class MyNum1
{1
Some operatorsare unary(one operand) – some are binary(two operands) and one of them isternary(three operands).0
	private int val;1
	public MyNum(int val)1
In this example, operators of division and multiplication have the same level ofprecedence and are evaluated left to right – left associative.0
	{1
		this.val = val;1
	}1
An expression has a value – of a particular type.0
This is decided by the language.0
	public void solveTowerOfHanoi() 1
	{1
		// move val disks from 1 to 3 using 21
		moveRecursive(val, 1, 3, 2 );1
	}1
Division of integers in many languages results in an integer.0
So 1 / 2 becomes 0and now you can figure out why we get zero.0
The above program finds the area of a triangle of base 10 and height 20.0
	private void moveRecursive(int n, int from, int to, int using)1
What if Iwant to find area of triangle with different bases and heights.0
	{1
You may rememberthat in the school days, we learnt arithmetic and then algebra.0
In algebra, welearnt the concept of variables.0
Variables could take different values.0
		if(n > 0)1
		{1
			moveRecursive(n - 1, from, using, to);1
			System.out.println(from + " => " + to);1
How do weuse the same idea in programming.0
To take input from the keyboard, we have to refer to it in the program.0
			moveRecursive(n - 1, using, to, from);1
It is calledSystem.0
in.0
System.0
out refers to output and System.0
		}1
	}1
in refers to input.0
}1
Readingfrom the keyboard is complicated as we may decide to input a number or a stringor special characters.0
To handle this, we use a type(class) called Scanner that Javaprovides.0
public class Client1
{1
We make a variable of that type, bind it to the keyboard and then we willask it to get us the next integer.0
To take input from the keyboard, we have to refer to it in the program.0
	public static void main(String[] args)1
It is calledSystem.0
	{1
in.0
		MyNum n = new MyNum(25);1
System.0
out refers to output and System.0
in refers to input.0
		System.out.println("res : " + n.what());	1
Readingfrom the keyboard is complicated as we may decide to input a number or a stringor special characters.0
To handle this, we use a type(class) called Scanner that Javaprovides.0
We make a variable of that type, bind it to the keyboard and then we willask it to get us the next integer.0
	}1
}1
public class MyNum1
This list is not complete.0
We will discuss more of them later.0
In this example, b is a variable of type int.0
This statement causes allocation ofmemory of 4 bytes.0
Java supports 8 types – called primitive types – byte, char,short, int, long, boolean, float and double.0
Unlike 'C', size of each type is fixed inJava.0
{1
Can you find the size of each of these types.0
	private int val;1
	public MyNum(int val)1
Thats a bad idea.0
What if I had a polygon with n sides (n > 3)? We may have tospecify n sides and a few more elements to define the figure uniquely.0
	{1
In stead ofcarrying books separately, you may want to carry them in a bag.0
		this.val = val;1
	}1
	public int whatRecursive(int val)1
Then we can talkabout the book in Rama's bag or the book in Krishna's bag.0
	{1
Each of these classes can be in their own files.0
		if(val == 0)1
		{1
			return 0;1
		}1
		else if(val % 2 == 1)1
A program in Java can consist ofnumber of files – each file having one or more classes.0
A file can have only onepublic class and in that case, the file name should match the class name.0
		{1
			return 1 + whatRecursive(val / 2);1
Why should we develop programs in multiple files? This would allow developmentby different people, therefore would make the development faster.0
		}1
This alsoallows for reuse.0
		else1
		{1
			return whatRecursive(val / 2);1
The class developed can be used by others.0
		}1
	}1
	public int what()1
	{1
		return whatRecursive(val);1
	}1
This concept iscalled a library in programming parlour.0

	Test() { t3 = 3; }1
	private final int t4 = 4;1
Let us look at some examples.0
In these discussions, we will use a simple exampleof a class - Rect – which abstracts a rectangle.0
	{1
My rectangle has two attributeslength called l and breadth called b.0
Both are of type int.0
I am sure your rectanglecould be different.0
		// Error1
We know that everything changes in this world.0
How do we manage change? Thedeveloper of the class Rect should tell the client that he would not change thosethat the client can use and he may change those which the client cannot use.0
		//t4 = 44; // what if t4 = 4 ?1
He should hide the implementation and expose the interface.0
	}1
In this example, the client accesses the interface of Rect.0
}1
Changes toimplementation of Rect will not affect the client.0
In this example, can the Client find the area of a rectangle within which a smallrectangle is cut out? The answer is a NO as the client can only display the areaand cannot get the area.0
// reference becomes constant and not its reference1
public class Client1
This implementation of findArea is flawed.0
{1
It should return the area back to theclient.0
	public static void main(String[] args)1
The client can then decide what to do with it.0
So far we have been telling you the truth, but not the whole truth.0
The operator new allocates memory for the fields of Rect andthen calls a special method called the constructor.0
	{1
This constructor is used toinitialize an object.0
		MyNum n1 = new MyNum(10);1
It does not create an object.0
Constructor can have parameters.0
Compiler provides a constructor which has noparameters.0
		MyNum n2 = n1;1
This is called a default constructor.0
This will vanish when we makeout own constructor.0
The client may want to use our class to initialize objects indifferent ways.0
		n2.set(20);1
You may order pizza with different toppings and with or withoutcoke.0
		System.out.println("n1 : " + n1.get()); // 20 why?1
		// what happens what n2 referred to earlier?1
We may have overloaded constructors to support what the client wants.0
		n2 = new MyNum(200);1
		System.out.println("n1 : " + n1.get()); // 20 why?1
Giving a value or set of values to a variable or an object at the point of creation iscalled initialization.0
		final MyNum n3 = new MyNum(30);1
Local variables are not initialized by default.0
		System.out.println("n3 : " + n3.get());1
Object is created by using the operator new.0
It allocates memory and calls theconstructor.0
Our rectangle has changed with an additional field to indicate whether therectangle is a square.0
		//n3 = n1; // Error1
It has methods to get the values of the attributes for theclient.0
		//n3 = new MyNum(300); // Error1
		n3.set(300);1
		System.out.println("n3 : " + n3.get());1
These are called getters.0
We may have methods to change the values ofthe attributes of an object.0
	}1
These are called setters.0
Observe that isSquare depends on the other fields – we say it is a computed field.0
}1
This is given a value in the constructors.0
public class MyNum1
{1
	private int val;1
	public MyNum(int val)1
	{1
		this.val = val;1
Constructors are overloaded to make the client life easier.0
Default constructor initializes the fields to some default (not reasonable in thisexample – could not think of a default rectangle!).0
	}1
We have a constructor which creates a square – takes only one argument.0
We have also a constructor which takes two arguments.0
	public int get()1
	{1
If a constructor does everything tht another constructor does and then somethingmore, we can make one call the other.0

The phenomenon occurs if the angle of incidence is greater than a certain limiting angle, called the critical angle.0
In general, total internal reflection takes place at the boundary between two transparent media when a ray of light in a medium of higher index of refraction approaches the other medium at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle.0

The motion of a pendulum is a classic example of mechanical energy conservation.0
A pendulum consists of a mass (known as a bob) attached by a string to a pivot point.0
As the pendulum moves it sweeps out a circular arc, moving back and forth in a periodic fashion.0
Neglecting air resistance (which would indeed be small for an aerodynamically shaped bob), there are only two forces acting upon the pendulum bob.0
One force is gravity. The force of gravity acts in a downward direction and does work upon the pendulum bob.0

This equation states that 1 iron (Fe) atom will react with two oxygen (O) atoms to yield 2 iron atoms and 3 oxygen atoms(The subscript number, such as the two in O2 describe how many atoms of an element are in a molecule.).0
{	1
This unbalanced reaction can't possibly represent a real reaction because it describes a reaction in which one Fe atom magically becomes two Fe atoms.0
Therefore, we must balance the equation by placing coefficients before the various molecules and atoms to ensure that the number of atoms on the left side of the arrow corresponds exactly to the number of elements on the right.0

Tension is an external force and if it did do work upon the pendulum bob it would indeed serve to change the total mechanical energy of the bob.0

According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-like.0

A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.0
Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.0
It must not present original research.0

A report in August 2014 showed that Wikipedia had at least 80,000 editors.0
A significant decline in the number of English-language editors was reported in 2013 by Tom Simonite who stated: "The number of active editors on the English-language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51,000 and has been declining ever since...(t)his past summer (2013) only 31,000 people could be considered active editors.".0
Several attempts to explain this have been offered.0
	}1
One possible explanation is that some users become turned off by their experiences.0
Another explanation, according to Eric Goldman, is found in editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions.0
Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references".0
Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation", but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.0

In this paper, we propose a multiple-choice question generation methodology for understanding evaluation of adjectives in a text.0
	{1
Based on the sense association among adjectives, an adjective being examined can be usually substituted by some other adjectives.0
In order to discourage learners from answering questions by recalling memorized answers, and to expose learners with more vocabularies, the answer of the questions generated is a substitute of the adjective being examined.0

The candidates of a substitute are gathered from WordNet and filtered by web corpus searching.0

By restricting syntax, we better enable them to focus on understanding the content that is being communicated.0
	//Example2.java:26: error: = expected1
	//int x1
We are using an analogous approach.0
That is, unlike many natural language researchers, we are not concerned with parsing the full syntactic complexity of, say, the New York Times.0

Glass casting is the process in which glass objects are cast by directing molten glass into a mould where it solidifies.0
The technique has been used since the Egyptian period.0
Modern cast glass is formed by a variety of processes such as kiln casting, or casting into sand, graphite or metal moulds.During the Roman period moulds consisting of two or more interlocking parts were used to create blank glass dishes.0
Glass could be added to the mould either by frit casting, where the mould was filled with chips of glass (called frit) and then heated to melt the glass, or by pouring molten glass into the mould.Evidence from Pompeii suggests that molten hot glass may have been introduced as early as the mid-1st century CE.Blank vessels were then annealed, fixed to lathes and cut and polished on all surfaces to achieve their final shape.Pliny the Elder indicates in his Natural History (36.193) that lathes were used in the production of most glass of the mid-1st century.Sand casting involves the use of hot molten glass poured directly into a preformed mould.0

A model can be made of any solid material such as wax, wood or metal and after taking a cast of the model, (a process called investment), the model is removed from the mould.0
One method of forming a mould is by the Cire perdue or "lost wax" method.0

The heat resistant mould is then placed in a kiln with a funnel like refractory opening which is filled with solid glass granules or lumps.0
The kiln is heated to a high temperature, normally between 800 and 1000 degrees Celsius (1472 - 1832 F), and as the glass melts it runs, settling into and filling the mould.Such kiln cast work could be made of very large proportions such as by the Czechoslovakian artists Stanislav Libensky and Jaroslava Brychtova.0

Kiln cast glass has become an important material for contemporary artists such as Clifford Rainey and Karen LaMonte.Pâte de verre is another form of kiln casting and literally translated means glass paste.0
In this process, finely crushed glass is mixed with a binding material, such as a mixture of gum arabic and water, and often with colourants and enamels.0
The resultant paste is applied to the inner surface of a negative mould forming a coating.0
	{1
After the coated mould is fired at the appropriate temperature the glass is fused creating a hollow object that can have thick or thin walls depending on the thickness of the pate de verre layers.0

Tropomyosin receptor kinase B is the high affinity catalytic receptor for several "neurotrophins", which are small protein growth factors that induce the survival and differentiation of distinct cell populations.0
The neurotrophins that activate TrkB are: BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3).0
As such, TrkB mediates the multiple effects of these neurotrophic factors, which includes neuronal differentiation and survival.0

Research has shown that activation of the TrkB receptor can lead to down regulation of the KCC2 chloride transporter in cells of the CNS.0

A receptor tyrosine kinase is a "tyrosine kinase" which is located at the cellular membrane, and is activated by binding of a ligand to the receptor's extracellular domain.0

here is one other BDNF receptor besides TrkB, called the "LNGFR" (for "low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor").0
As opposed to TrkB, the LNGFR plays a somewhat less clear role in BDNF biology.0
}1
Some researchers have shown the LNGFR binds and serves as a "sink" for neurotrophins.0
Cells which express both the LNGFR and the Trk receptors might therefore have a greater activity - since they have a higher "microconcentration" of the neurotrophin.0
// discuss about the Object class1
It has also been shown, however, that the LNGFR may signal a cell to die via apoptosis - so therefore cells expressing the LNGFR in the absence of Trk receptors may die rather than live in the presence of a neurotrophin.0
rone music, drone-based music, drone ambient, ambient drone, or simply drone, is a minimalist musical genre that emphasizes the use of sustained or repeated sounds, notes, or tone-clusters – called drones.0
It is typically characterized by lengthy audio programs with relatively slight harmonic variations throughout each piece compared to other musics.0
//	equals1
//	hashCode1
La Monte Young, one of its 1960s originators, defined it in 2000 as "the sustained tone branch of minimalism".0
public class Example21
usic which contains drones and is rhythmically still or very slow, called "drone music", can be found in many parts of the world, including bagpipe traditions, among them Scottish pibroch piping; didgeridoo music in Australia, South Indian classical Carnatic music and Hindustani classical music (both of which are accompanied almost invariably by the tambura, a plucked, four-string instrument which is only capable of playing a drone); the sustained tones found in the Japanese gagaku classical tradition; possibly (disputed) in pre-polyphonic organum vocal music of late medieval Europe; and the Byzantine chant's ison (or drone-singing, attested after the fifteenth century).0
{1
Repetition of tones, supposed to be in imitation of bagpipes, is found in a wide variety of genres and musical forms.0
However, the lineage of stillness and long tones occurring in classical compositions during adagio movements, including, for instance, the third movement of Anton Webern's Five Small Pieces for Orchestra, as well as in Northern European folk musics in the form of "slow airs" has directly descended into modern popular and electronic music.0

The modern genre also called drone music (called "dronology" by some books, labels and stores, to differentiate it from ethnic drone-based music) is often applied to artists who have allied themselves closely with underground music and the post-rock or experimental music genres.0
Drone music also fits into the genres of found sound, minimalist music, dark ambient, drone doom/drone metal, and noise music.0

Timbre is reduced to either a single clear instrument or a sine wave, silence disappears completely, and the base-level interaction between small clusters of "pure" tone becomes the music's content.0
This kind of work takes what typically helps us to distinguish "music" from "sound," discards nearly all of it, and then starts over again from scratch.0
La Monte Young, fascinated with "the sound of the wind blowing", the "60 cycle per second drone" of "step-down transformers on telephone poles", the tanpura drone and the alap of Indian classical music, "certain static aspects of serialism, as in the Webern slow movement of the Symphony Opus 21", and Japanese gagaku "which has sustained tones in it in the instruments such as the Sho", started writing music incorporating sustained tones in 1957 with the middle section of For Brass, then in 1958 what he describes as "the first work in the history of music that is completely composed of long sustained tones and silences" with Trio for Strings, before exploring this drone music within the Theatre of Eternal Music that he founded in 1962.0
The Theatre of Eternal Music is a multi-media performance group who, in its 1960s–1970s heyday included at various times La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, Tony Conrad, Angus MacLise, Terry Jennings, John Cale, Billy Name, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea and others, each from various backgrounds (classical composition and performance, painting, mathematics, poetry, jazz, etc.0
Operating from the world of lofts and galleries in New York in the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies in particular, and tied to the aesthetics of Fluxus and the post-John Cage-continuum, the group gave performances on the East Coast of the United States as well as in Western Europe comprised long periods of sensory inundation with combinations of harmonic relationships, which moved slowly from one to the next by means of "laws" laid out by Young regarding "allowable" sequencies and simultaneities, perhaps in imitation of Hindustani classical music which he, Zazeela and the others either studied or at least admired.0
The group released nothing during their lifetime (although Young and Zazeela issued a collaborative LP in 1969, and Young contributed in 1970 one side of a flexi-disc accompanying Aspen magazine).0
		// value semantics1
The concerts themselves were influential on their own upon the art world including Karlheinz Stockhausen (whose Stimmung bears their influence most strikingly) and the drone-based minimalist works of dozens of other composers many of whom made parallel innovations including Young classmate Pauline Oliveros, or Eliane Radigue, Charlemagne Palestine, Yoshi Wada, Phill Niblock and many others.0

In 2000, La Monte Young wrote: "[About] the style of music that I originated, I believe that the sustained tone branch of minimalism, also known as “drone music,” is a fertile area for exploration.0

This rare release was far removed from the band's usual rock-based music, however the usage of drone elements in these songs was still apparent, particularly in the song "Heroin", which consisted of Cale's grinding viola drone with Reed's two-chord guitar figure.0
This song, appearing on the band's first album The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), laid the foundation for drone music as a rock music genre in close proximity to the art-world project of the Theatre of Eternal Music.0
Cale's departure from the group in 1968 blurred matters considerably, as Reed continued to play primitive figures (sometimes in reference to R&B), while Cale went quickly on to produce the Stooges' debut (1969), including his viola drone on the track "We Will Fall" and Nico's The Marble Index (1969) which also included Cale's viola drone on "Frozen Warnings".0

Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory) is a fundamental branch of physics which describes physical phenomena at scales typical of the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic length scales, where the action is on the order of the Planck constant.0

At these scales, many everyday concepts concerning physical objects and energy (including the photons making up visible light) are believed to behave and interact extremely differently than is usually seen in daily life.0
Quantum mechanics provides an extremely accurate description of the behavior of photons, electrons, and other atomic- and molecular-scale objects.0

At larger (macroscopic) scales its predictions simplify to become the laws of classical mechanics familiar in the everyday world, although even in the everyday world, many phenomena can be observed with the naked eye, which cannot be explained classically but require a quantum mechanical explanation.0
Important applications of quantum mechanical theory include superconducting magnets, LEDs and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as MRI and the electron microscopy, and explanations for many biological and physical phenomena.0
Quantum mechanics takes its name from the observation that some physical quantities exist, and can change and interact, only by discrete amounts (in a 'step-like' manner) and behave probabilistically rather than deterministically.0
The "steps" are so tiny that they are completely imperceptible even with a microscope, and any description must be given in terms of a wave function rather than specific particles and movements.0
The term "quantum" itself (plural: quanta) comes from the Latin word quantus meaning how much?, referring to a 'packet' (or amount) of energy, momentum, or any other attribute that is quantized and can only change by discrete amounts.0

	public boolean equals(Object o)1
This tiny scale is why quantum mechanics generally leads to classical mechanics in macroscopic situations: - the vast numbers of quantum effects involved in everyday observations means that discrete quantum behaviors are usually hidden by much larger statistical effects (similar to "averaging").0
Other fundamental quantum mechanical principles are wave-particle duality (quanta exhibit both 'wave-like' behaviors such as refraction and 'particle-like' behavior), the uncertainty principle (attempting to measure one attribute such as velocity or position may cause another attribute to become less measurable), and superposition and the status of the observer (a wave function superimposes multiple co-existing states that have different probabilities; observation causes collapse of the wave function to some specific state, in several interpretations , as in the famous example of Schrödinger's Cat).0
Quantum mechanics was initially developed as a field in the early 20th century, driven by the black-body radiation problem (reported 1859) and Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric effect (reported 1887).0
Around 1900-1910, the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively.0

Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics.0
For instance, in a quantum mechanical model, the lowest energy state of a system, the ground state, is non-zero as opposed to a more "traditional" ground state with zero kinetic energy (all particles at rest).0
Instead of a traditional static, unchanging zero energy state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic possibilities, according to John Wheeler.0

Planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete "quanta" (or energy elements) precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body radiation.0

In fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery.0

He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.0

Quantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation and description of the atom, especially the differences in the spectra of light emitted by different isotopes of the same chemical element, as well as subatomic particles.0

n the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac, David Hilbert, John von Neumann, and Hermann Weyl, the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called state vectors).0
Formally, these reside in a complex separable Hilbert space—variously called the state space or the associated Hilbert space of the system—that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor).0
In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space.0

This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand.0
It was the central topic in the famous Bohr-Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments.0
In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a "measurement" has been extensively studied.0
Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of "wavefunction collapse" (see, for example, the relative state interpretation).0
The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wavefunctions become entangled, so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity.0
For details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics.0

Generally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values.0
Instead, it makes a prediction using a probability distribution; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable.0
Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds.0
	return 31
Probability clouds are approximate (but better than the Bohr model) whereby electron location is given by a probability function, the wave function eigenvalue, such that the probability is the squared modulus of the complex amplitude, or quantum state nuclear attraction.0
Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the "instant" of the measurement.0
Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value.0

There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable.0
These are known as eigenstates of the observable ("eigen" can be translated from German as meaning "inherent" or "characteristic").0
In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate.0
}1
Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence.0
// Wrong design1
However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate pairs) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather, it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability.0
// subclass cannot support every method of the superclass1
// this is  a clearly a case of composition and not inheritance1
Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values (eigenstates).0
public class Example11
Usually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in.0
However, if one measures the observable, the wavefunction will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or "generalized" eigenstate) of that observable.0

This process is known as wavefunction collapse, a controversial and much-debated process that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device.0
	public static void main(String[] args1
	{1
If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wavefunction collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.0
For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0 (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum).0
When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.0
It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the wave function is large.0
		Room r = new Room();1
After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x.0
The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger equation, in which the Hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system) generates the time evolution.0

A time-evolution simulation can be seen here.0
Wave functions change as time progresses.0
The Schrödinger equation describes how wavefunctions change in time, playing a role similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics.0
The Schrödinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it).0
However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time.0
	{1
This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.0

Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement.0
Such wavefunctions are directly comparable to Chladni's figures of acoustic modes of vibration in classical physics, and are modes of oscillation as well, possessing a sharp energy and, thus, a definite frequency.0
The angular momentum and energy are quantized, and take only discrete values like those shown (as is the case for resonant frequencies in acoustics).0
Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant, or independent of time—such as when in a stationary state of constant energy, time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function.0

The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction.0
The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems.0
A simpler approach, one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field.0
For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical \scriptstyle -e^2/(4 \pi\ \epsilon_{_0}\ r) Coulomb potential.0
This "semi-classical" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged particles.0
Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed.0
The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons.0

The initial condition and the final condition of the system are respectively described by values in a configuration space, for example a position space, or some equivalent space such as a momentum space.0
Quantum mechanics does not admit a completely precise description, in terms of both position and momentum, of an initial condition or "state" (in the classical sense of the word) that would support a precisely deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition.0
In this sense, advocated by Bohr in his mature writings, a quantum phenomenon is a process, a passage from initial to final condition, not an instantaneous "state" in the classical sense of that word.0
Thus there are two kinds of processes in quantum mechanics: stationary and transitional.0
For a stationary process, the initial and final condition are the same.0
For a transition, they are different.0
Obviously by definition, if only the initial condition is given, the process is not determined.0

It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed.0
Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent.0
In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision.0
{1
An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.0
Classical kinematics does not primarily demand experimental description of its phenomena.0

Classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics.0

For processes that need account to be taken of actions of a small number of Planck constants, classical kinematics is not adequate; quantum mechanics is needed.0
ven with the defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence, and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least with regard to their primary claims), they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent, cohesive model.0

Einstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics.0
While clearly contributing to the field, he did not accept many of the more "philosophical consequences and interpretations" of quantum mechanics, such as the lack of deterministic causality.0
He is famously quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, "My God does not play with dice".0
He also had difficulty with the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time.0
		this.fan = fan;1
However, he was also the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement, and used them to formulate the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications if taken as a complete description of physical reality.0
This was 1935, but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell (see Bell inequality) that - although Einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality - these implications could be experimentally tested.0

Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation—the common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927 - and contrary to Einstein's ideas, quantum mechanics was not, at the same time a "realistic" theory and a "local" theory.0
The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox shows in any case that there exist experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner - although the two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart.0
However, this effect does not violate causality, since no transfer of information happens.0

Quantum entanglement forms the basis of quantum cryptography, which is used in high-security commercial applications in banking and government.0
Gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications.0
However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant "Theory of Everything" (TOE).0
Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th and 21st century physics.0

Many prominent physicists, including Stephen Hawking, have labored for many years in the attempt to discover a theory underlying everything.0
This TOE would combine not only the different models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature - the strong force, electromagnetism, the weak force, and gravity - from a single force or phenomenon.0
While Stephen Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of Everything, after considering Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, he has concluded that one is not obtainable, and has stated so publicly in his lecture "Gödel and the End of Physics" (2002).0
he quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing.0

Quantum electrodynamics (or "quantum electromagnetism"), which is currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most accurately tested physical theory in competition with general relativity,[unreliable source?](blog) has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force.0
Current predictions state that at around 1014 GeV the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field.0
Beyond this "grand unification", it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries, expected to occur at roughly 1019 GeV.0
However — and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics — the expanded general relativity, currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory.0

One of those searching for a coherent TOE is Edward Witten, a theoretical physicist who formulated the M-theory, which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory.0
M-theory posits that our apparent 4-dimensional spacetime is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are - at lower energies - completely "compactified" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.0
Another popular theory is Loop quantum gravity (LQG), a theory first proposed by Carlo Rovelli that describes the quantum properties of gravity.0

 According to Steven Weinberg, "There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.0
}1
The Copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is currently most widely accepted amongst physicists, some 75 years after its enunciation.0
According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered a final renunciation of the classical idea of "causality.0
 It is also believed therein that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the conjugate nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.0
Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, rejected the quantum theoretical doctrine that the state of a system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement.0
// both points by embedding	1
He held that underlying quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against action at a distance; in other words, he insisted on the principle of locality.0
He inferred that the present theory was incomplete, contrary to the Copenhagen doctrine that it is complete.0
He therefore produced a series of objections, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox.0
John Bell showed that this "EPR" paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables.0
Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby demonstrating that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon by addition of hidden variables.0

The Bohr-Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view.0
The Everett many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes.0
	{1
		one = new Point(x1, y1);1
		two = new Point(x2, y2);1
This is not accomplished by introducing some "new axiom" to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary, by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet.0
All of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including the observer) are present in a real physical - not just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations - quantum superposition.0
	}1
Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state.0
While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.0
	public void dispOne()1
 the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit.0
Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable.0
However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence, these "parallel universes" will never be accessible to us.0
The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe.0
	{1
In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured.0
Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one could theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory).0
In light of these Bell tests, Cramer (1986) formulated his transactional interpretation.0
