Earthquake mainly occurs when the different blocks or plates that make up the Earths surface move relative to each other, causing distortion in the rock. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training DNNs that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer. The large output layer is required to accommodate the large number of HMM states that arise when each phone is modeled by a number of different triphone HMMs that take into account the phones on either side. Even when many of the states of these triphone HMMs are tied together, there can be thousands of tied states. Using the new learning methods, several different research groups have shown that DNNs can outperform GMMs at acoustic modeling for speech recognition on a variety of data sets including large data sets with large vocabularies.
